I'm trying to come up with an unambiguous and creative general theme description that defines the theme for a singleplayer RPG adventure. So far, I've come up with $1. Generate a theme description that includes worldbuilding related information and the player's location. Your output must be just the theme description, therefore you may not include additional output such as "Sure! Here is the theme description.".
